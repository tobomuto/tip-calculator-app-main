## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (with gulp to render and update the css)
- Vanilla Javascript (no Jquery)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I experimented with this challenge the mobile-first workflow, indeed better than a desktop focused css.
- Just to try something new, I used gulp to render SASS in css.
- I'm used to work on vue, I wanted to do this with only vanilla JS.


### Continued development

- I guess my code is pretty ugly and not very maintanable. I need to work on that.
- Should check on BEM css
